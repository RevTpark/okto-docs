Now, you might have noticed that the Okto Bottomsheet looks the same for any app, regardless of its design. What if we told you there was a way to theme the bottom sheet to fit your app's design?

### Customizing the Bottom Sheet
In you `App.tsx` file, we will use the [`setTheme`](/sdk-reference/setTheme) method to customize the bottom sheet. This method should be ideally called at the root of your app. You can check the method documentation for more details on the parameters it accepts.

```tsx filename="App.tsx" copy
import { init, setTheme } from 'rn-okto-sdk';

init("API_KEY");
// Just as an example, we are setting the backgroundColor to black
setTheme("", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "#000000");
```
<div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: 12 }}>
    <div style={{ width: "30%" }}>
        ![Wallet Created](/customize/wallet.jpg)
    </div>
    <div style={{ width: "30%" }}>
        ![Wallet](/customize/others.jpg)
    </div>
</div>

And that's it! It's as simple as that. Now, when you pull up the bottom sheet, it will be themed according to your app's design.

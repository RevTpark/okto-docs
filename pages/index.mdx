# Okto Wallet SDK Docs 
## Why Okto?
 
In the fast-paced world of Web3, Okto Wallet is all about applications driving widespread adoption. We focus on crafting user-centric applications, making complex infrastructure invisible to end-users. Developers thrive in Web3 with Okto, as we handle the wallet complexities, allowing them to focus solely on creating top-notch applications without worrying about wallet safety and user trust.

Furthermore, we offer two distinct APIs for your development needs. The Client API is designed for apps interacting directly with users, while the Server to Server (S2S) API handles centralized admin tasks. Okto gives you the flexibility to choose the right API, whether you're building user-focused applications or managing backend operations seamlessly.

Now, you might be wondering which API is right for you. That brings us to the next section.

## Which API to use?
Choosing between Client API and S2S API depends on your specific use case. We have a points of comparison to help you decide which API is best for your application.

| Feature | Client API   | S2S API |
| :----- | :----- | :----: |
**User Intended App** | Designed for user-facing applications (dApps) | Primarily used for Admin/Superadmin operations |
**Independence** | dApp functions independently of servers | Executes operations across all users centrally |
**Runtime Logic** | Handles runtime application logic | Performs admin-related operations on behalf of users |
**Offline Transactions** | Limited capability if user is offline | Enables transactions even when users are offline |
**Example Use Case** | Selling NFT: Requires both parties online | Selling NFT: Servers can trade off-chain when users are offline |
**Async Portfolio Updates** | Typically not suitable for async updates | Ideal for receiving asynchronous updates on portfolios |

### What we recommend?
If you're building a user-focused app and need real-time interaction, go for the Client API. However, if you're dealing with admin tasks, offline transactions, or asynchronous updates, the S2S API is your go-to solution.
